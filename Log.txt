Inverter Development Log

25/3/2024
- Initiated the Code for P,Q and Idref calculation
- Initiated Git Version Control ( Which is not 100 %? )
- DDSRF-Control (on progress) 

31/3/2024
-Changed referencegen and building the basics.
-Initiated ZOH on all inputs (10kHz refresh)(require study for discrete time systems.)
-Updated Logic initialization method ( detect changes in Value);
-Using Trapezoial Method for integration. (Need further development) (Check with gemini)
*for energy signal, E is finite and P is 0 (Check Energy signals in DSP, might )

1/4/2024
-C Function is finalized for this application
-Initializing the Development for the generation in Matlab and VS code
-Trapezoial Method is implemented. 
-Implemented Vdref and Idref Calculation. Data Collection Function and condition is still yet to be developed.
-Matlab Simulink C function is still yet to be configured. (https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/integrate-external-c-algorithms-using-c-function-block.html)
