Inverter Development Log

25/3/2024
- Initiated the Code for P,Q and Idref calculation
- Initiated Git Version Control ( Which is not 100 %?, and now it is )
- DDSRF-Control (on progress) 

31/3/2024
-Changed referencegen and building the basics.
-Initiated ZOH on all inputs (10kHz refresh)(require study for discrete time systems.)
-Updated Logic initialization method ( detect changes in Value);
-Using Trapezoial Method for integration. (Need further development) (Check with gemini)
*for energy signal, E is finite and P is 0 (Check Energy signals in DSP, might )

1/4/2024
-C Function is finalized for this application
-Initializing the Development for the generation in Matlab and VS code
-Trapezoial Method is implemented. 
-Implemented Vdref and Idref Calculation. Data Collection Function and condition is still yet to be developed.
-Matlab Simulink C function is still yet to be configured. (https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/integrate-external-c-algorithms-using-c-function-block.html)
 
 2/4/2024
 -The Idea of implement simulation time is finalized as using other tic/toc timer probably will be more troublesome
 -Thinking about the idea of implementing main loop in the output and input for C function.
 -Discussed with ChatGPT (Hurray! Gemini Sucksss) about the C-Function. Will develop the code after the finalized C source function.

*Notes for C Fcn Block:
Output Block:
Write the code that the block executes during simulation (not sure whether the code will loop or do I need to add a while loop for it)
Start and Terminate Code:
The code that will execute during start and the end of the simulation (used for conditioning and also declaration of the variable)

4/4/2024
-All Functions variable is defined internally.
-Updated the algoritm flow with all the system defined within the C Function Block.
-

10/4/2024
-Changes in the C Function Block. Will have the DataValidate thingy built-it.
-Considering to implement Relay Control with the C Function block. This will largely improve the systems performance and future expandabiliy if I want to implement more control.
-Need to understand again about the reference generation. Will try to make the thingy work this week.
-learn back how AC system works! Then I can make a sensible Power Meter for Reference.

11/4/2024
-Changed the method of obtain DeltaT (yeay now it works)
-Implemented changes to the C Funtion. Now it checks whether the PLL is synced.
-Changes in the Function of the C Function. Nothing major but to optimize it.
Next Job:
* Design the DDSRF Systems with accurate Id and Iq. Discuss about the oscillation with Mr Chai and ChatGPT for a solution. 
* Check back with the Thesis, check with the equation and the implementation and design the data aquicission.

18/4/2024
-Starting the development of the DDSRF Reference Frame. 
-Understand about the positive and negative sequence of the three phase systems, need to understand how to obtain the phasor of the system.
-Changed the Sync State method, changed to current monitoring ZCD instead of Voltage based.

Next Job:
* Understand and complete the design for DDSRF.
* Based on the paper, redesign the Grid Load and also implement a Three Phase Systems for testing.

20/4/2024
~LegacyDevelopment Branch
-Modified the Negative Sequnce Generation code
-Changed C Library to Cpp extention.
-Otw changing complex number handler from pointer to class* (require development.)
-DDSRF 3 phase will be developed after the DDSRF works on current single phase model.

28/4/2024
-DDSRF Development had started
-Currently Designing the Reference for the DDSRF Power
-PWM Modulator still needed to be properly designed.
-Currently the System can compile and run, just need improvement. estimated ending development day is at 4 May 2024

29/4/2024
-Initialized the Inverse Matrix Calculation for the reference generation. 
-Built the inverse matrix calculation.

2/5/2024
-Use the internal LU Inverse Block for the Inverse Matrix (You sohai bro)
-Impelment different control reference generation method shown in the System
-The PWM will be implemented using a cascaded Bridge Inverter VSI topology. (To save time deadline at 4 may)

3/5/2024
-DDSRF Reference Gen can now follow the voltage!
-Still need to determine how to control the Power
-3 Phase 4 wire modulation method need to be determined
-Still need to fill some info for the presentation
